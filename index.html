      This paper will discuss the recent and ongoing developments in the use of artificial 
      intelligence within the medical environment; specifically robotically-controlled surgical 
      procedures, highlighting both recent major advancements and emerging challenges. 
      The focus will be primarily on AI-driven algorithms and adaptability across all operational 
      scenarios. The study will review pre-existing examples of where artificial evidence and robotics 
      is already being incorporated into the medical and surgical field as well as further possible 
      developments in more fields of healthcare.

    <pre>
      Over the years, the use of tools in surgical procedures has developed rapidly and with the 
      increased use and improvement in the use of artificial intelligence, it was only a matter of time 
      before AI was implemented into the medical and surgical settings.

      Robotics has become an indispensable and increasingly used component of modern surgical procedures. 
      It has appeared across multiple specialities from general surgery to cardiology and neurosurgery. 
      Commercial platforms such as Intuitive’s  da Vinci robotic surgery system have allowed surgeons to 
      perform complex invasive procedures such as hysterectomies and segmental lung resections among 
      other - with enhanced dexterity, tremor filtration and three-dimensional visualisation, often leading 
      to smaller incisions, reduced loss of blood and a much faster recovery for the patient. Many orthopaedic 
      programmes use robotic arm mechanism such as Stryker’s Mako offering patient-specific 3D planning and 
      operative guidance that improves the positioning of mechanisms such an implants. Robotic platforms such as 
      Zimmer Biomet’s ROSA are now engaged for deep brain stimulation, biopsy procedures that require extremely 
      high accuracy and stereo electroencephalography (SEEG). As well as these products, there are also examples 
      of real world applications. The ‘Lindbergh operation’ in 2001 was a transatlantic, tele-operated 
      cholecystectomy (surgical removal of a gall bladder), showcasing the technical feasibility of long-distance 
      telesurgery and inspired further investments in latency reduction technology. These technologies indicate a 
      future where robotic systems are integrated with improved real-time imaging and AI driven decision making - 
      transferring from surgeon-operated machines towards machines controlled by artificial intelligence that 
      mimics human skills with increased precision.

      Many hospitals and treatment centres have now reported improved clinical metrics when robotics have been 
      implemented in appropriate cases; analysis has shown that since the introduction of this technology, there 
      have been fewer conversions to open surgery, lower rates of transfusion and shortened hospital stays for 
      patients. Research developments advancing these benefits include machine learning that aid to refine 
      mechanical motion and image segmentation, CAT/MRI scans with endoscopic views and haptics/force-feedback 
      prototypes. However, the widescale implementation of these systems remains uneven due to 3 primary limitations. 
      Firstly, the costs to install and maintain surgical robots and their accessories are very high, producing a 
      barrier for many hospitals and health centres. Secondly, surgeons and medical staff require intense, prolonged 
      training and credentials to be able to operate the machinery safely and effectively - investment in time and 
      personal that not all hospitals would be able to support. Lastly, the integration of new machinery and devices 
      can be difficult due to older systems not working smoothly with new robotic platforms, causing workflow problems 
      that may affect the efficiency. These technical and economic restrictions suggest that more solid evidence and 
      access options are needed to make robotic surgery more widely accessible. Studies also suggest that robotic 
      benefit is not universal and will rely on the complexity of the case, the surgeon experience and the specific 
      device(s) used, therefore research now focuses on identifying which patients and procedures gain the most from the 
      use of robotics. Certain health systems are also experimenting with mobile robotic units that can rotate between 
      surgical centres to broaden the access while prioritising expertise.
