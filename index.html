      This paper will discuss the recent and ongoing developments in the use of artificial intelligence within the medical environment; specifically robotically-controlled 
      surgical procedures, highlighting both recent major advancements and emerging challenges. The focus will be primarily on AI-driven algorithms and adaptability across 
      all operational scenarios. The study will review pre-existing examples of where artificial evidence and robotics is already being incorporated into the medical and 
      surgical field as well as further possible developments in more fields of healthcare.

      Over the years, the use of tools in surgical procedures has developed rapidly and with the increased use and improvement in the use of artificial intelligence, it was 
      only a matter of time before AI was implemented into the medical and surgical settings.

      Robotics has become an indispensable and increasingly used component of modern surgical procedures. It has appeared across multiple specialities from general surgery 
      to cardiology and neurosurgery. Commercial platforms such as Intuitive’s  da Vinci robotic surgery system have allowed surgeons to perform complex invasive procedures 
      such as hysterectomies and segmental lung resections among other - with enhanced dexterity, tremor filtration and three-dimensional visualisation, often leading to 
      smaller incisions, reduced loss of blood and a much faster recovery for the patient. Many orthopaedic programmes use robotic arm mechanism such as Stryker’s Mako 
      offering patient-specific 3D planning and operative guidance that improves the positioning of mechanisms such an implants. Robotic platforms such as Zimmer Biomet’s 
      ROSA are now engaged for deep brain stimulation, biopsy procedures that require extremely high accuracy and stereo electroencephalography (SEEG). As well as these 
      products, there are also examples of real world applications. The ‘Lindbergh operation’ in 2001 was a transatlantic, tele-operated cholecystectomy (surgical removal of 
      a gall bladder), showcasing the technical feasibility of long-distance telesurgery and inspired further investments in latency reduction technology. These technologies 
      indicate a future where robotic systems are integrated with improved real-time imaging and AI driven decision making - transferring from surgeon-operated machines towards 
      machines controlled by artificial intelligence that mimics human skills with increased precision.

      From the following data, we can see the evolution in the use of the DaVinci robot over the years. Between 2015 and 2021, the amount of procedures using the DaVinci robot
      has increased dramatically. Between 2015 and 2020, the number of procedures increased by between 5.8 thousand (2017-2018) to 8.8 thousand (2016-2017). However, between
      2020 and 2021, it increased drastically by 41.8 thousand. This highlights the ongoing developments in the machinery as well as the more recent advances. This data also 
      indicates to us that the machinery and systems are constantly improving and being implemented and will only increases in use and become further refined.

      Many hospitals and treatment centres have now reported improved clinical metrics when robotics have been implemented in appropriate cases; analysis has shown that since 
      the introduction of this technology, there have been fewer conversions to open surgery, lower rates of transfusion and shortened hospital stays for patients. Research 
      developments advancing these benefits include machine learning that aid to refine mechanical motion and image segmentation, CAT/MRI scans with endoscopic views and 
      haptics/force-feedback prototypes. However, the widescale implementation of these systems remains uneven due to 3 primary limitations. Firstly, the costs to install and 
      maintain surgical robots and their accessories are very high, producing a barrier for many hospitals and health centres. Secondly, surgeons and medical staff require 
      intense, prolonged training and credentials to be able to operate the machinery safely and effectively - investment in time and personnel that not all hospitals would be 
      able to support. Lastly, the integration of new machinery and devices can be difficult due to older systems not working smoothly with new robotic platforms, causing 
      workflow problems that may affect the efficiency. These technical and economic restrictions suggest that more solid evidence and access options are needed to make 
      robotic surgery more widely accessible. Studies also suggest that robotic benefit is not universal and will rely on the complexity of the case, the surgeon experience 
      and the specific device(s) used, therefore research now focuses on identifying which patients and procedures gain the most from the use of robotics. Certain health systems 
      are also experimenting with mobile robotic units that can rotate between surgical centres to broaden the access while prioritising expertise.

      The ethical queries that surround the use of robotics in surgery are equally important as the technical ones. As surgical robots move towards higher levels of AI and 
      automation, questions arise surrounding the responsibility when things may go wrong; was the fault a misjudgement by the surgeon, a technical malfunction, an issue in the 
      software or inadequate maintenance/training? Recent ethical literature recommends governance framework to define liability and practices that disclose automation levels and 
      potential failure modes to patients. On the technical end, robots present other risks - bugs in the software, mis-calibration, sensor failures and vulnerability in 
      cybersecurity. These require rigorous premarketing testing, continuous surveillance in operation and fail-safe designs to ensure patient safety. Hospitals must also budget 
      for maintenance, sterilisation cycles, and training of staff as well as operating-room layouts and scheduling. Finally, fair access is a moral issue; if wealthy facilities 
      receive the majority of equipment and machinery, patients in need of care in areas with limited resources may not receive the benefits that have been demonstrated. 
      Ultimately, the future course of surgical robots will be determined not only by the advancements in engineering, but also how hospitals, clinicians and manufacturers 
      work together to ensure the technology is safe, affordable and equally distributed.
